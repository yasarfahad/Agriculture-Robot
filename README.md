# Agriculture-Robot
It is a Agricultural Robot it is used to perform various operations in the agricultural fields. I have used Arduino Uno which is a microcontroller. In our robot, it performs operations like Drilling, Seeding, Watering, Closing seed. These operations can be done manually through application which is developed using MIT App Inventor. In this application it has buttons for navigating robot in any direction like left, right, forward or backward direction and for drilling, seeding, watering are having buttons on clicking these a command will be passed to the Arduino Uno through the Bluetooth module which is connected to the Arduino uno board. By using this it has many advantages, we can have more production of crops in less time, Man power can be reduced, by using robots it can work whole day 24x7 and all 365 days.
